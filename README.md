# WayTO-Navigation
## Developing and Testing diﬀerent Visualizations of Oﬀ-Screen Landmarks for Car Navigation Systems
### Project for Master's Thesis - handed in on 12.09.2016

The use of car navigation systems is a convenient way to reach a destination. However, users often become device-focused and develop only a reduced understanding of their environment. Common navigation systems focus on the route and its instructions. Landmarks are seldom used in navigation systems, yet they are important elements to support spatial orientation during wayﬁnding tasks. One way to convey information about landmarks is to display them in a navigation system’s map interface. Due to limited screen sizes and map scales, landmarks are mostly outside the mapped area. This work develops and tests two types of visualizations of oﬀ-screen landmarks to support spatial orientation while navigating. Implemented as Android Application.

### Status
Implemented two different visualizations of off-screen landmarks
#### Wi-Fi Pointers:

#### Wedges:

##### Further key feature
Simulating and playing car drives from gpx waypoint files.
